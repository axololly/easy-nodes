### Chai
Thanks to Chai ([@trevorfl](https://gist.github.com/trevorflahardy)) for:

- helping to review my code and suggesting improvements like:
    - replacing assertations with `isinstance()` checks and raising appropriate errors
    - improving usage of the `search_for()` function    

- teaching me what a sentinel is, why you should use it and where you should use it
